     <p>This is the first paragraph. In printed text, paragraphs are traditionally rendered by merely breaking the flow of text to the next line and then indenting the first line of the new paragraph. In web pages, however, a new paragraph is typically rendered by breaking the flow of text to the next line which then contains a line of 'white space'. The blank line is subsequently followed by the new paragraph whose first line appears flush with the left margin.</p><p>This is the next paragraph. Note that any line breaks created in the source code by pressing the 'Enter' key will be ignored by the web browser when it displays the web page. Creating line breaks in the visible text can only be accomplished by using one of various HTML elements. In this case, we are using the 'p' element.</p>
